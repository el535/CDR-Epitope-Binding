# CDR-Epitope-Binding

The recognition of antigens by T-cells and B-cells are a core part of the human immune system's protection against viruses, bateria, and even cancer. This project sets out to predict the binding of T-cells with an Epitope, a part of an antigen that is recognized by the T-cell.
